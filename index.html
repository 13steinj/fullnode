<p>fullnode is a javascript implementation of bitcoin intended to satisfy certain
goals:</p>
<p>1) Support ease-of-use by being internally consistent. It should not be
necessary to read the source code of a class or function to know how to use it.</p>
<p>2) Have 100% test coverage, or nearly so, so that the library is known to be
reliable. This should include running standard test vectors from bitcoin core.</p>
<p>3) Library objects have an interface suitable for use with a command-line
interface and API, in particular having toString, fromString, toJSON, fromJSON,
methods. Other common methods are toBuffer, fromBuffer relevant for binary
formats such as transactions and blocks.</p>
<p>4) All standard features of the bitcoin protocol are implemented and saved in
lib/. All BIPs are correctly implemented and, where appropriate, saved as
bipxx.js in lib/ (since that is their standard name). Any non-standard features
(such as SINs and stealth addresses) are placed in the lib/expmt/ folder and
are accessible at fullnode.expmt. Once they are standardized and given a BIP,
they are renamed and placed in lib/.</p>
<p>5) It is always possible to create a new object without using &quot;new&quot;.</p>
<p>6) Compatible with browserify (i.e., using require(&#39;fullnode/lib/message&#39;)
should work both in node, and be automatically work in the browser with used in
conjunction with browserify).</p>
<p>7) Minimize the use of dependencies so that all code can be easily audited.</p>
<p>8) All instance methods modify the state of the object and return the object,
unless there is a good reason to do something different.  To access the result
of an instance method, you must access the object property(s) that it modifies.</p>
